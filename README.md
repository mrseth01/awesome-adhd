From [ADDitude.mag](https://www.additudemag.com/), The meaning of ADHD is complex. It’s a misunderstood neurological disorder that impacts the parts of the brain that help us plan, focus on, and execute tasks. ADHD symptoms vary by sub-type — inattentive, hyperactive, or combined — and are often more difficult to diagnose in girls and adults. Here, we review the symptoms, causes, types, and tests associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Easily bored, sensitive to distractions, creative and intense. If you grew up with ADHD, chances are you always felt "different." Now here's a scientific explanation, finally, of why we act the way we do.

## Dr. Daniel Amen

Longer form video going over the various types of ADHD types and treatments.  He avoids prescription medications if he can and has created natural products.

## Dr. Russell Barkley

He is very pro-medication. He's probably the best the AMA/Father paradigm has to offer, so I try to be careful of his authority in the psyche. His videos offer the most in-depth understanding of ADHD, what he thinks the DSM-V gets wrong, etc. Argues that Executive Fuctioning Disorder and ADHD are more strongly correlated than the AMA currently believes.

This is a long (2.5 hours) and complete video of a leading researcher giving a talk to parents of children with ADHD. He describes ADHD as being an Executive Function Disorder and redefines ADHD away from the DSM terminology somewhat.

## Dr. Hallowell

Dr. Hallowell wrote a book called Driven to Distraction that was influential in educating a lot of people about ADD beyond ADHD being an excuse to give pain in the ass little boys pills to calm them in class.

He also has an office in New York: [http://www.drhallowell.com/the-hallowell-centers/the-hallowell-center-new-york-ny/](http://www.drhallowell.com/the-hallowell-centers/the-hallowell-center-new-york-ny/)

# What do we do now?

Learn about your brain, get diagnosed properly (find out what type of ADHD you're working with), eat well, exercise well, take supplements, do a bunch of things to offset the difficulty with motivation, planning, etc, and take medications if necessary.
